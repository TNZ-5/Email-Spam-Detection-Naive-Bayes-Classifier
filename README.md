## About The Project

The Email Spam Detection project focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms to effectively identify and classify spam messages. It involves the analysis and comparison of different types of neural networks to produce valuable insights for improving the spam detection process.

One of the key components of the project is the development of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model specifically designed for spam detection. This model is then compared with a Naive Bayes Classifier to evaluate their respective effectiveness in accurately identifying spam messages.
